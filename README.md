# Sales-Prediction-using-ML
This project predicts sales for a fashion brand using machine learning algorithms, leveraging historical sales data to forecast future sales. Utilizing training and testing datasets, the project employs data preprocessing techniques, such as imputation and one-hot encoding, to prepare the data for model training. Three machine learning models - Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor - are evaluated, with the best performing model selected based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. The project provides a comprehensive approach to sales prediction, offering insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for forecasting sales in the fashionÂ industry.
